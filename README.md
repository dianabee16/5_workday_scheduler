# Work Day Scheduler
This is a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. Users are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours, and each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. They are able to enter events on each timeblock and save it for future reference.
